The following packages need to be installed to build this package
from CVS.
  perl (I use v5.6.0 but other versions may work)
  libtool (CVS version)
  gettext 0.11.5
  autoconf 2.50 or better
  automake 1.5 (earlier versions *might* work)
And to build the manual
  LyX*
  LaTeX Installing
  Latex2html
  w3m

libtool *must* be the CVS version for the C++ support.  The released
version will not work.

If you do not wish to build the manual use "make fake-manual" in the
manual directory before building the rest of the source.

* Since LyX depended on non free software which in a conflict of interest
  for the FSF the generated TeX files are also included so that LyX is
  not needed unless you plan on editing the manual.  If you wish to 
  work on the manual but do not which to use LyX please contact me.
  The eventual goal is to convert the manual into Texinfo.  Once done
  this problem will go away.

Before the build:

  ./autogen

  ./configure --disable-static <options> 
  or ./config-opt <options> or ./config-debug <options>

The ./config-* will set things up for easier development.  If you want
to install Aspell to use it rather than develop with it than use the
normal configure.  When config-* is used the default things will be
installed in <build dir>/inst for easier testing and debugging. You
can change that by using the --prefix option.  

Autogen should be run when ever anything but the source files or
Makefile.am files are modified by either yourself or a cvs update.

Than to build and install:

  make
  make install

You will then need to install a dictionary package for the new Aspell.
You can find them at http://aspell.net.  If Aspell is installed
somewhere other than /usr/local you will probably need to add
<prefix>/bin to your PATH or make symbolic links to the executable in
order for the dictionary to build correctly.

To run the debugger on these programs if there are not installed use
  libtool gdb <debugger parms>
or
  libtool --mode execute <your debugger> <debugger parms>
For example to debug aspell with ddd use
  libtool --mode execute ddd prog/.libs/aspell

Using libtool is necessary to make sure the shared libraries get loaded
right. If you debug them after they are installed this will not be
necessary.
