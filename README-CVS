This is still rather incomplete so only use for development purposes.

The following packages need to be installed to use this package:
  perl (I use v5.6.0 but other versions may work)
  libtool (CVS version, HEAD branch)
  autoconf 2.50 or better
  automake 1.5 (earlier versions *might* work)

Before the build:

  ./autogen
  ./config-opt # or ./config-debug

Use ./config-* instead of configure as the ./config-* will add the
necessary options so that things build right with this very limited
version of the New Aspell.  Any parameters specified will be passed to
configure.

Than to build:

  make
  ./mk-dict # to build the dictionary
 
You can then optionally due a "make install" to install the programs in
the inst/ directory.

To test things out use either aspell0 or speller-util. If you did a
make install both of these programs are in inst/bin/ otherwise they
are in example/ and modules/speller/default/ respectfully.  aspell0 is
a slightly modified version of the example program distributed with
the released version of Pspell.  Speller-util is a skimmed down
version of Aspell which can be used for creating or dumping
dictionaries.

To run the debugger on these programs if there are not installed use
  libtool gdb <debugger parms>
or
  libtool --mode execute <your debugger> <debugger parms>
For example to debug speller-util with ddd use
  libtool --mode execute ddd modules/speller/default/speller-util

Using libtool is necessary to make sure the shared libraries get loaded
right. If you debug them after they are installed this will not be
necessary.

Using static libraries will NOT work due to the mixing of C and C++.

Autogen should be run when ever anything but the source files or
Makefile.am files are modified by either yourself or a cvs update.
