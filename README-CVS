The following packages need to be installed to build this package
from CVS.
  perl (I use v5.6.0 but other versions may work)
  libtool 1.5 or better
  gettext 0.13
  autoconf 2.50 or better
  automake 1.5 (earlier versions *might* work)
And to build the manual
  LyX*
  LaTeX Installing
  Latex2html
  w3m

If you do not wish to build the manual use "make fake-manual" in the
manual directory before building the rest of the source.

Before the build:

  ./autogen

  ./configure --disable-static <options> 
  or ./config-opt <options> or ./config-debug <options>

  make manual or make fake-manual

The ./config-* will set things up for easier development.  If you want
to install Aspell to use it rather than develop with it than use the
normal configure.  When config-* is used the default things will be
installed in <build dir>/inst for easier testing and debugging. You
can change that by using the --prefix option.

The "make manual" is necessary to bootstrap the manual.  If you don't
do it the build may fail.  Use "make fake-manual" if you do not wish
to build the manual.

Autogen should be run when ever anything but the source files or
Makefile.am files are modified by either yourself or a cvs update.

Than to build and install:

  make
  make install

You will then need to install a dictionary package for the new Aspell.
You can find them at http://aspell.net.  If Aspell is installed
somewhere other than /usr/local you will probably need to add
<prefix>/bin to your PATH or make symbolic links to the executable in
order for the dictionary to build correctly.

To run the debugger on these programs if there are not installed use
  libtool gdb <debugger parms>
or
  libtool --mode execute <your debugger> <debugger parms>
For example to debug aspell with ddd use
  libtool --mode execute ddd prog/.libs/aspell

Using libtool is necessary to make sure the shared libraries get loaded
right. If you debug them after they are installed this will not be
necessary.
