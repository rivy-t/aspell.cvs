language to use, it follows the same format of the LANG environmental
variable on most systems. It consists of the two letter ISO 639 language
code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a dash or

.TP
.BI "\-\-strip\-accents="boolean

.SH CHECKER OPTIONS
These options control the behavior of Aspell when checking documents.
.TP
.BI "\-W,\-\-ignore="integer
ignore words <= n chars 
.TP
.BI "\-\-ignore\-case="boolean
ignore case when checking words
.TP
.BI "\-\-ignore\-accents="boolean

.TP
.BI "\-\-sug\-mode="mode

.SH FILTER OPTIONS
These options modify the behavior of the various filters.
.TP
.BI "\-\-filter="list
add or removes a filter
.TP
.BI "\-\-mode="string

The encoding the input text is in. Valid values are ``utf-8'',
``iso8859-*'', ``koi8-r'', ``viscii'', ``cp1252'', ``machine unsigned
16'', ``machine unsigned 32''. However, the Aspell utility will
currently only function correctly with 8-bit encodings. utf-8 support is
planned for the future. The two ``machine unsigned'' encodings are
intended to be used by other programs using the Aspell library and it
is unlikely the Aspell utility will ever support these encodings.
.TP
.BI "\-\-add|rem\-email\-quote="list

.TP
.BI "\-\-email\-margin="integer

.PP
In addition Aspell will try to make sense out of ispell's command line
options so that it can function as a drop in replacement for ispell.  If
Aspell is run without any command line options it will display a brief help
screen and quit.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Aspell can also accept options via a personal or global configuration
file. The exact files to used are specified by the options per-conf and
conf respectfully but the personal configuration file is normally
.I ".aspell.conf"
located in the
.B "$HOME"
directory.
.pp
Each line of the configuration file has the format:
.PP
.RS
.BI "option "[value]
.RE
.PP
where 
.B option
is any one of the standard library options above without the leading
dashes.  For example the following line will set the default language to
Swiss German:
.PP
.RS
.B lang de_CH
.RE
.PP
There may any number of spaces between the option and the value however
it can only be spaces, i.e. there is no '=' between the option name and
the value. Comments may also be included by preceding them with a '#' as
anything from a '#' to a newline is ignored. Blank lines are also
allowed.  Values set in the personal configuration file override those
in the global file. Options specified at either the command line or via
an environmental variable override those specified by either
configuration file.
.PP
The global configuration file for Aspell is 
.I "/etc/aspell.conf"
and the per user configuration file is 
.I "~/.aspell.conf"
