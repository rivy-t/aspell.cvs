MODE sgml

# This mode file requires the following Aspell version(s)
# Key: ASPELL
# Value: [<realtion operator>]<requiredversion>
# 
# the relation operator can be one of `<', `<=', `=', `>=' or '>'
# for allowing Aspell version with version number being 
# lower, lower or equal, equal, greater or equal or greater than
# required version number.
# if relation operator is omitted `=' is assumed.
ASPELL >=0.51

# the magic line contains a description which requirements files
# have to fulfill in order to implicitly activate the entire mode
# at least one such line is required.
# Its value has the following format:
#    /<magic key>/<fileextention>{/<fileextention>}
#
# The magic key consist of three `:' separated fields:
# The first two are byte counts the last is a regular expression.
# The first byte count indicates the first byte the regular expression
# will be applied to the second byte count indicates the number of
# bytes to test against the regular expression.
#
# If mode selection should only occur on basis of the listed file
# extensions the magic key may be empty or contain the following two
# special strings:
#   <nomagic>
#   <empty>
#
# At least one <fileextention> is required per MAGIC line.
# <fileextions may not be empty and may not contain a leading `.'
# as this is assumed implicitly.
#
# Multiple MAGIC lines are allowed. Modes may be extended limited by additional
# <label>.amf files located in --filter-path
# Thus file extensions may be preceded by `+' or `-' to indicate that
# the entire extension has to be added ore removed from this <magic key>
# if none of both is given `+' is assumed implicitly.

# This line will be printed when typing `aspell help' 
# NOTE: this line is required as it indicates the end of the mode file header.
#       thus if missing mode will be rejected by Aspell.
#       keep it as short as possible although line wrapping will be done implicitly
#       possible abbreviations are `des' and `desc'
